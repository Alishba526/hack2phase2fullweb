# Plan Multi-User Todo Web Application

## PROMPT_TEXT

```

```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Completed the implementation planning for the Multi-User Todo Web Application. Created the following design artifacts:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Outlining the technical approach and project structure
2. Research document (research.md) - Detailing technology decisions and alternatives
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Defining the User and Todo entities with relationships
4. API contracts (contracts/auth-contract.md, contracts/todo-contract.md) - Specifying authentication and todo operation endpoints
5. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Providing setup and usage instructions

All artifacts comply with the project constitution, emphasizing spec-driven development, clear separation of concerns, backend-first architecture, and security-first authentication. The plan is ready for the next phase: task breakdown.

## OUTCOME

The implementation plan for the Multi-User Todo Web Application is complete with all required design artifacts. The project can now proceed to the task breakdown phase.
